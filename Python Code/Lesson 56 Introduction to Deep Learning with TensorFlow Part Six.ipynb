    "### II. Gradients and Automatic Differentiation in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "During the past decade, TensorFlow wasn't the only platform researchers developed to solve large-scale deep learning prolems. A variety of powerful neural net frameworks have been developed, including Torch, Caffe, Theano, and PyTorch. These frameworks make it easy to quickly implement a sophisticated neural net model. By far, TensorFlow is the most sophisticated package we have and it has many advantages. Here are some of the features provided by TensorFlow and by some or all of the other frameworks besides TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Automatic differentiation.: if one implements a neural net directly on top of base package such as 'numpy', much of the implementational work involves writing procedures to compute derivatives. TensorFlow automatically constructs routines for computing derivatives which are generally at least as efficient as the ones we would have written by hand.\n",
    "  - Compiling computation graphs: if we implement a network in base package such as 'numpy', a lot of time is wasted allocating and deallocating memory for matrices. TensorFlow takes a different approach: you first build a graph defining the network's computation, and TensorFlow figures out an efficient strategy for performing those computations. It handles memory better and performs some other code optimizations.\n",
    "  - GPU: graphics processing units (GPUs) are a particular parallel architecture which has been especially powerful in training neural nets. It can be a huge pain to write GPU routines at a low level, but TensorFlow provides an easy interface so that the same code can run on either a CPU or a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ANN projects, backpropogation is the secret sauce to the problems. Gradient descent inevitably requires computation of derivatives. TensorFlow has many built-in solutions for computing gradient and perform differentiation. Recall that **automatic differentiation** (AD) is a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Automatic differentiation is a complicated topic, We won't cover all of it. But what is fundamental to this concept is the chain rule. There are two related concepts that need to be understood: forward accumulation (or forward mode) and reverse accumulation (or reverse mode). For simplicity, let's use a univariate example. Suppose we have the following problem and we are interested in computing $f'(x)=\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - $y=f(g(h(x)))=f(g(h(w_{0})))=f(g(w_{1})b)=f(w_{2})=w_{3}$\n",
    "   - $w_{0}=x$, $w_{1}=h(w_{0})$, $w_{2}=g(w_{1})$, $w_{3}=f(w_{2})=y$\n",
    "   \n",
    "By the chain rule, we have:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - $f'(x)=\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{dy}{dw_{2}}\\frac{dw_{2}}{dw_{1}}\\frac{dw_{1}}{dw_{0}}=\\frac{f(w_{2})}{dw_{2}}\\frac{dg(w_{1})}{dw_{1}}\\frac{dh(w_{0})}{dw_{0}}$\n",
    "   \n",
    "Usually, two distinct modes of AD are presented, forward accumulation (or forward mode) and reverse accumulation (or reverse mode). Forward accumulation specifies that one traverses the chain rule from inside to outside (so we first compute $\\frac{dw_{1}}{dw_{0}}$, then $\\frac{dw_{2}}{dw_{1}}$ etc.) while reverse accumulation has the traversal from outside to inside (so we first compute $\\frac{dw_{3}}{dw_{2}}$ then $\\frac{dw_{2}}{dw_{1}}$ etc.).

    "We now study how TensorFlow implements differentiation. Recall that to compute weights in ANN, we need to invoke backpropagation, which consists of two phases: forward pass and backward pass. To differentiate automatically, TensorFlow needs to remember what operations happen in what order during the forward pass. Then, during the backward pass, TensorFlow traverses this list of operations in reverse order to compute gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow provides the tf.GradientTape() API for automatic differentiation; that is, computing the gradient of a computation with respect to some inputs, usually tf.Variables(). TensorFlow basically \"records\" relevant operations executed inside the context of tf.GradientTape() onto a \"tape\". It then uses that tape to compute the gradients of a \"recorded\" computation using the reverse mode differentiation.\n",

One of them is about controlling what the tape 'watches'. When we create a tape through the instance tf.GradientTape(), we are basically asking TensorFlow to keep track of whatever needs to be recorded for perform differentiation (and backpropagation for deep learning). The most useful application of a gradient 'tape' is when you design a custom layer in your keras model. \n",

    "### III. Graphs and Functions in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand graphs, we first need to go over the concept of eager execution. TensorFlow's **eager execution** is an imperative programming environment that evaluates operations immediately, without building some pre-made 'container' or roadmap: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later. This makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow and debug models, and it reduces boilerplate as well. In TensorFlow 2.0 version above, eager execution is enabled by default. In other words, eager execution implies that TensorFlow operations are executed by Python, operation by operation, and returning results back to Python. Eager TensorFlow takes advantage of GPUs, allowing you to place variables, tensors, and even operations on GPUs and TPUs. However, running TensorFlow operation-by-operation in Python prevents a host of accelerations otherwise available. This is where graphs play a role in: if you can extract tensor computations from Python, you can make them into a graph. This makes our execution more flexibile in some of the scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Graphs** are data structures that contain a set of 'tf.Operation' objects, which represent units of computation; and 'tf.Tensor' objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. They are defined in a 'tf.Graph' context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code. You can use your TensorFlow graph in environments that don't even have a Python interpreter, like mobile applications, embedded devices, and backend servers. TensorFlow uses graphs as the format for saved models when it exports them from Python. In short, graphs are extremely useful and let your TensorFlow run fast, run in parallel, and run efficiently on multiple devices."

    "Now let's study how we can create and trace graphs. The way you create a graph in TensorFlow is to use tf.function(), either as a direct call or as a **Python decorator**. Before we move on, let's study Python decorator for a moment, which provides a simple syntax for calling **higher-order functions**. By higher-order function, we mean a function that either 1) takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters), or 2) returns a function as its result. By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it.\n",

This means you can assign them to variables, store them in data structures, pass them as arguments to other functions, and even return them as values from other functions. Let's use some examples here. Consider the following 3 functions. Two of the functions are common (say_hello() and be_awesome()) as they are regular in the sense that expect a name given as a string.

    "We have talked about tensors, variables, and functions in TensorFlow. Now let's try to build a simple linear model in TensorFlow from scratch. So we are not using Keras API in this section because Keras API is already pre-made based on TensorFlow (Keras is certainly not the only API, there are others within TensorFlow such as 'Estimator' API). Abstractly, in the raw TensorFlow platform, a model is a function that computes something on tensors (a forward pass) with some variables that can be updated in response to training. Most models are made of layers. Layers are functions with a known mathematical structure that can be reused and have trainable variables. In TensorFlow, most high-level implementations of layers and models, such as Keras or Sonnet, are built on the same foundational class: 'tf.Module'. Modules and, by extension, layers are deep-learning terminology for \"objects\": They have internal state, and methods that use that state. To understand how these modules are built, we need a bit of OOP knowledge. For now we will skip this hard part and just focus on basic classes, since TensorFlow already includes the 'tf.Keras' API, a high-level neural network API that provides useful abstractions to reduce boilerplate. \n",

Likewise, we can use 'tf.Module' to encapsulate the variables and the computation. We could use any Python object, but this way it can be easily saved. Here, both $w$ and $b$ are variables. For initial values, we use $(w^{(0)},b^{(0)})=(5.0,0.0)$. In practice, these initial values should be randomly chosen. In other words, the initial variables are set here in a fixed way, but Keras comes with any of a number of initalizers we could use:"

    "Notice that the code above is an application of OOP. The most abstruse line of code is the one that states 'def \\__init\\__'. What this does is that it packs all of the keyword arguments used in any given call to 'def \\__init\\__' into a dictionary object and super(). The statement expands them into keyword arguments again. Its like a wildcard for function parameters. It can be a lazy way to give the subclass the same parameter signature as the parent without bothering to type all of the possible keyword parameters in again. \n",
