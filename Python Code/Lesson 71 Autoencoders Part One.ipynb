    "### I. The Theory of Autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique in which we leverage neural networks for the task of representation learning. Specifically, we'll design a neural network architecture such that we impose a bottleneck in the network which forces a compressed knowledge representation of the original input. If the input features were each independent of one another, this compression and subsequent reconstruction would be a very difficult task. However, if some sort of structure exists in the data (ie. correlations between input features), this structure can be learned and consequently leveraged when forcing the input through the network's bottleneck. Suppose that we have input data $x$ with the autoencoder neural network $m(.)$. The idea is to send $x$ via $m(.)$ to project the input onto itself, hoping to find some type of representation in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an intuitive picture of what autoencoders may look like. Autoencoders can have different network structures but the basic idea comes from the picture below. We can take an unlabeled dataset $x$ and frame it as a supervised learning problem tasked with outputting $x$, a reconstruction of the original input $x$. This network can be trained by minimizing the reconstruction error, which measures the differences between our original input and the consequent reconstruction. The bottleneck is a key attribute of our network design; without the presence of an information bottleneck, our network could easily learn to simply memorize the input values by passing these values along through the network. In other words, in the picture, the hidden layers must have lower dimensionality than the dimensionality of the input, therefore 'compressing' the original data and learning its representation. In other words, the point of the bottleneck is to constrain the amount of information that can traverse the full network, forcing a learned compression of the input data. Below is a conceptual description of what an autoencoder looks like:"

    "\n",
    "   - sensitive to the inputs enough to accurately build a reconstruction;\n",
    "   - insensitive enough to the inputs that the model doesn't simply memorize or overfit the training data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "This trade-off forces the model to maintain only the variations in the data required to reconstruct the input without holding on to redundancies within the input. For most cases, this involves constructing a loss function where one term encourages our model to be sensitive to the inputs (i.e. reconstruction loss function $l(x,x'$) adopting the notation from the above picture and a second term discourages memorization or overfitting; that is, an added regularizer). This is the most natural way of reframing the problem, but in reality, there are other ways to achieve the same goal (an example is the sparse autoencoder, which will be discussed later). But the overall idea is the same: we need to balance the need between input reconstruction and overfitting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, an autoencoders is a specific type of feedforward neural network where the input is the same as the output. They compress the input into a lower-dimensional code and then reconstruct the output from this representation. The code is a compact 'summary' or 'compression' of the input, also called the **latent-space representation**. An autoencoder consists of 3 components: **encoder**, **code** and **decoder**. The encoder compresses the input and produces the code, the decoder then reconstructs the input only using this code. The idea is that our input data is converted into an encoding vector where each dimension represents some learned attribute about the data. Our encoder network is outputting a single value for each encoding dimension. The decoder network then subsequently takes these values and attempts to recreate the original input. So really we are learning the identity function, but with a twist. \n",

    "The simplest architecture for constructing an autoencoder is to constrain the number of nodes present in the hidden layer(s) of the network, limiting the amount of information that can flow through the network. By penalizing the network according to the reconstruction error, our model can learn the most important attributes of the input data and how to best reconstruct the original input from an \"encoded\" state. Ideally, this encoding will learn and describe latent attributes of the input data. An undercomplete autoencoder has no explicit regularization term; we simply train our model according to the reconstruction loss. Thus, our only way to ensure that the model isn't memorizing the input data is the ensure that we've sufficiently restricted the number of nodes in the hidden layer(s).

    "One result of this fact is that we allow our network to sensitize individual hidden layer nodes toward specific attributes of the input data. Whereas an undercomplete autoencoder will use the entire network for every observation, a sparse autoencoder will be forced to selectively activate regions of the network depending on the input data. As a result, we've limited the network's capacity to memorize the input data without limiting the networks capability to extract features from the data. This allows us to consider the latent state representation and regularization of the network separately, such that we can choose a latent state representation (ie. encoding dimensionality) in accordance with what makes sense given the context of the data while imposing regularization by the sparsity constraint.\n",

    "   - L1 regularization: we can add a term to our loss function that penalizes the absolute value of the vector of activations $a(.)$ in layer $h$ for observation $i$, scaled by a tuning parameter $\\lambda$: $l(x, \\hat{x})+\\lambda\\sum_{i}|a^{(h)}|$.\n",
    "   - KL-Divergence: in essence, KL-divergence is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. We can define a sparsity parameter $\\rho$ which denotes the average activation of a neuron over a collection of samples. This expectation can be calculated as $\\rho_{j}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i}a^{(h)}(x)$ where the subscript $j$ denotes the specific neuron in layer $h$, summing the activations for $n$ training observations denoted individually as $x$. In essence, by constraining the average activation of a neuron over a collection of samples we're encouraging neurons to only fire for a subset of the observations. We can describe $\\rho$ as a Bernoulli random variable such that we can leverage the KL divergence to compare the ideal distribution $\\rho$ to the observed distributions over all hidden layer nodes $\\hat{\\rho}$: $l(x, \\hat{x})+\\lambda\\sum_{j}\\text{KL}(\\rho, \\hat{\\rho}_{j})$.\n",

    "Autoencoders have many applications. Two of the most important applications are data compression (for both image and tabular data) as well as outlier detection. The literature in outlier detection is rich and researchers have had many existing algorithms such as **local outlier factor**, **isolation forests**, **one-class SVM**, **hidden Markov models**, **deviations from association rules and frequent itemsets**, **feature bagging (random subspace bagging)** etc. However, autoencoders and **Baynesian networks** stand as two algorithms based on deep learning.

    "### II. An MNIST Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We now use an simple example to see how autoencoders perform on a toy dataset. To build an antoencoder, we will need 3 things: an encoding function , a decoding function, and a distance function between the amount of information loss between the compressed representation of the data and the decompressed representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a code sample using TensorFlow applied to the MNIST dataset. The encoder will consist of a stack of 2D convolutionary layers and 2D max-pooling layers (for spatial downsampling), while the decoder will consist of a stack of 2D convoluationary layers and 2D upsampling layers (the corresponding Python class in TensorFlow is UpSampling2D() which exists in TensorFlow version 2.6 above in the 'keras' module). Before we build the toy example of autoencoders on the MNIST data, let's first look at what upsampling is in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upsampling concept really comes from a sub-field of deep learning techniques called **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, which are architecture for training generative models, such as deep convolutional neural networks for generating images. The idea is to use existing data to train a network that can produce something similar to the training dataset. An example is chatbox automation task. Here, we are training a network to learn how to talk like a real person. Another one is to generate random images based on existing data. GANs in general are complicated topics so we will not go into details now. But the most important thing is to realize what it does for the time being. \n",
    "\n",
    "The GAN architecture can be comprised of both a **generator model** and a **discriminator model**. We will not discuss the latter and only touch on the former. The generator model is responsible for creating new outputs, such as images, that plausibly could have come from the original dataset. The generator model is typically implemented using a deep convolutional neural network and results-specialized layers that learn to fill in features in an image rather than extract features from an input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common types of layers that can be used in the generator model are upsample layers that simply double the dimensions of the input and the transpose convolutional layers that perform inverse convolution operations. For the upsampling layer, this is where the UpSampling() layer comes in play. Here is what UpSampling2D() looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -  UpSampling2D(_size_=(2, 2), _data\\_format_=None, _interpolation_='nearest', _kwargs_)\n",
    "\n",
    "This class simply repeats the rows and columns of the data by size[0] and size[1] respectively. The input must be a 4D tensor. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - if _data\\_format_ is \"channels_last\": then the tensor should be arranged as (batch_size, rows, cols, channels)\n",
    "   - if _data\\_format_ is \"channels_first\": (batch_size, channels, rows, cols)\n",
