    "We will be focusing on reading in 4 types of data: csv files, excel files, html files, and SQL tables. To ensure we can actually read in these types of files, we first need to ensure that the following libraries are installed: 'sqlalchemy', 'lxml', 'html5lib', and 'BeautifulSoup4'. To install these four libraries, you can open up the Anaconda prompt, and then type in the following four commands separately: 1) conda install sqlalchemy 2) conda install lxml 3) conda install html5lib 4) conda install BeautifulSoup4. Anaconda prompt will install the package for you as long as the package is not pre-installed. After all this, you can type the following command to check whether the libraries have been properly installed: conda list. Once you install these libraries, you need to restart your jupyter notebook. If you don't have the Anaconda distribution, you can use the 'pip install' option to install packages. "
