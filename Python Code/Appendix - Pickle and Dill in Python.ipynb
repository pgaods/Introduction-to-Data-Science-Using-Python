    "As a data scientist, one may work with different types of data in varieties of forms such as dictionaries, 'DataFrames' objects, lists or any other data types. In many times we want to save them to a file, so we can use them later on or send them to someone. For example, instead of recreating a final dataset that needs to go through a lengthy script, we can simply get the 'pickled' dataset for later use (as if from a jar!). It's useful for ML because when you are wokring with some algorithms, you wan to save them to be able to make new predictions at a later time, without having to rewrite everything or retrain the model all over again. This is the basic idea of 'picklin: it is used for serializing and de-serializing Python object structures, also called **marshalling** or **flattening**. **Serialization** refers to the process of converting an object in memory to a byte stream that can be stored on disk or sent over a network. later on, this character stream can then be retreived and deserialized back to a Python object. **Pickling** is not the same as compression. The former is the conversion of an object from one representation (data in RAM to anther), while the latter is the process of encoding data with few bits, in order to save disk space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pickling is specific to Python language, so if you want to use data across different programming languages, pickle is not recommended. Also, unpickling a file that was pickeld in a different version of Python may not alawys work propertly. In Python, we can pickle objects of the following data types: booleans, integers, floats, complex numbers, tuples, strings, lists, sets, dictionaries, classes, functions, 'DataFrame' objects etc. However, not everything can be pickled easily, examples of this include generators, inner classes, lambda functions and 'defaultdict' objects. In thes case of lambda functions, you need to use an additional package called 'dill'. With 'defaultdict' objects, you need to create them with a module-level function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickle is very similar to JSON, which stands for 'JavaScript Object Notation'. JSON is a lightweight format for data-interchange, that is easily readable by humans. Although it was derived from JavaScript, JSON is standardized and language-independent. This is a serious advantage over pickle. It's also more secure and much faster than pickle. However, if you only need to use Python, then the pickle module is still a good choice for its ease of use and ability to reconstruct complete Python objects. An alternative is 'cPickle'. It is nearly identical to pickle, but written in C, which makes it up to 1000 times faster. For small files, however, you won't notice the difference in speed. Both produce the same data streams, which means that pickle and 'cPickle' can use the same files.\n"
